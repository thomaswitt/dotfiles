My personal dotfiles

- Clone this repo and run mac-settings.sh
- Make sure you read every file before blindly installing it
- Pull single files via curl/wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/thomaswitt/dotfiles/main/[â€¦]
- After mac updates consider `brew list | xargs brew reinstall` or `brew
  bundle dump --describe --global` followed by `brew bundle install --global`
